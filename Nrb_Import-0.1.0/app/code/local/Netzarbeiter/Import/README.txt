READ THIS:
This code is NOT production ready. It's purpose is a proof-of-concept, and that
it might be useful to base your own custom extension of the ImportExport
module on.
So, in order to be able to do ANYTHING useful with this module, you need to be
a developer. Otherwise, you are out of luck. I welcome feedback and questions
(even though I do not answer all, depending on time).

This code was created first for my talk at Magento Imagine in Feb. 2011 (LA), and
later extended for my talk at Meet-Magento in May 2011 (Leipzig).
